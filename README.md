## ü¶æ How it Works

This tool allows you to perform a face swap. Simply follow these steps:

1. **Upload Source:**
   - Choose between `src_picture` and `src_video` for the face you want to swap.
   - Note: You can only upload one source at a time, and the tool processes one task at a time.
2. **Upload Target:**
   - Upload `target_picture`, and our model will swap the face onto the source image or video.
3. **Submit and Wait:**
   - Click the submit button and patiently wait for the process to complete.
   - Keep in mind that face swapping in videos might take some time, so be patient! üòÖ

## ‚ùó Important Note
- Ensure that `target_picture` is uploaded for the face swap to work effectively.

Enjoy swapping faces and have a good laugh! üòÜ
